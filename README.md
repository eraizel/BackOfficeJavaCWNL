BackOfficeJavaCWNL
==================

This is a Back Office Java Software I am developing for a project in CWNL in London UK

The Assingment consists of a Main class Called Product with two sub Classes Book and Software

The case study requires a program to be built in java with an user interface. 
In the interface the user should be able to add a new book or software
also should be able to choose from a list of products which products a costumer
over the phone could order and at the end it should display a list of the products 
ordered and with to total to pay.
Costumers will not have a costumer interface as they make the order  over the phone.
